excerpt: "I am an Astrophysics/Physics undergrad at Arizona State University, graduating in Spring 2024.  I aim to get a PhD in Astronomy or Astrophysics, but I'll take a Master's for now if there's a waiting list. When I'm not looking at stars or dying with physics homework, I enjoy singing, dancing, reading, cooking, and playing games with friends/family or just by myself if the game's got a good story or has space features I can critique."
